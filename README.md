# Cmake POC

*REPOSITORY ABANDONED!*

Use this PDF utility to make PDF documents searchable. Create searchable PDF for free. Converting a scanned PDF file (e.g. an receipt, contract, etc ...) into a searchable PDF has an advantage. Thus you'll be able to seek for numbers and watchwords within the file by essentially utilizing the search capabilities of your PDF reader.
